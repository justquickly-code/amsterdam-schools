You are working in the "amsterdam-schools" repo.

SOURCE OF TRUTH
- Always follow docs/PRD.md and docs/ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md.
- If you change behavior or scope, update the relevant docs in the same PR.

CHANGE SIZE / SAFETY
- Make small, reviewable changes. Avoid big refactors unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer adding new code over rewriting working code.
- Do not remove features or files unless asked.

QUALITY BAR
- Every new feature must include:
  - validation (client and/or server as appropriate)
  - loading/empty/error UI states
  - basic tests OR a minimal test plan in the PR description

DATA HONESTY
- Open days are non-authoritative.
- Any UI showing open days must display:
  - "Open day times can change — confirm on the school’s own website."
  - a "Last synced" timestamp if available.

DOMAIN CONSTRAINTS
- Rating is a single 1–5 stars value.
- Shortlist is strictly capped at 12 and must prevent adding a 13th.
- Advies filtering supports combined advice with a toggle: either vs both.
- Home location input is NL postcode + house number.

STYLE
- Use TypeScript.
- Keep code simple and readable.
